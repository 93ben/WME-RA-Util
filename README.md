# WME-RA-Util
This script enables the ability to shift a roundabout N/S/E/W by a definable amount (default amount is 1 meter). This allows an editor to correctly place a roundabout that may be out of alignment with aerials (due to bad initial drawing, being created before aerials were updated, etc.) without needing to delete &amp; recreate the roundabout and thus lose segment history.
